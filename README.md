`Image1`


"Code_basic_has_not_black_background" is the code to process each frames that the output has not a black background , I sovled this problem by using _cv2.BORDER_REPLICATE_ that I took the border pixels of the old frame and added them to the missing part of the new frame to avoid black background, the output likes image2.
